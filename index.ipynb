    "### Computing Placeholder Values\n",
    "\n",
    "A common strategy for dealing with null values is to replace them with the mean or median for that column.  This strategy is often preferable because it allows us to save data instead of dropping it.  However, we risk artificially modifying the distribution of the dataset by injecting a bunch of noise into it.  For this reason, we choose the mean or median to replace the missing values, since they preserve the summary statistics of the distribution for the given column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be very thoughtful about when to use this method, as often times it can introduce more problems than it solves, and possibly have a significant negative impact on your data during the modeling step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we decide to use the median or mean, we should first examine the distribution of the data.  If the distribution is skewed, the mean might not actually be as representative of the underlying data as it seems, because an outlier could be skewing it in a certain direction.  If the data is normally distributed and centered, then the mean is a good choice--otherwise, we should consider using the median. \n",

Of course, this is only a good idea if the number dropped does not constitute a significant portion of our dataset.  Often, you'll need to make the overall determination to see if dropping the values is an acceptable loss, or if it is a better idea to just drop an offending column (e.g. the `'Cabin'` column) or to impute placeholder values instead.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Missing Values with Placeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "A common thing to see when working with datasets is missing values denoted with a preassigned code or symbol, such as `'?'` or `0`.  This is especially common in the real world for industries such as health care. Often times, databases require all data entry to have some sort of value, so the data entry team just fills in the missing values with a pre-agreed upon term or symbol that denotes that the value is missing.  Pandas will not pick these up! They see it as just another entry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it is important to familiarize yourself with the dataset's **_Data Dictionary_**.  Any special cases such as this should be denoted there. However, in datasets where we do not have a Data Dictionary, it is a good practice to check to see what unique values can be found in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE_**: This is most common (and easiest to miss) in non-numeric data, because the offending null values will just look like another label.  However, when in numeric data, you will typically see null values encoded as 0, or possibly as an extremely large number that is clearly out of place in the distribution (e.g. `Age` = `9999`).\n",
